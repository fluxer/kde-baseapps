Pâté Instructions
=================

Pâté requires that you have installed:

  ∙ Qt4 devel
  ∙ KDE4 devel
  ∙ sip
  ∙ PyQt4
  ∙ PyKDE4

Most Linux distributions should provide packages for these. More details on
which specific packages are required for different distros is listed below
in the "Distribution-specific Information" section".

Compilation
===========

In the directory that you want to build Kate with Pâté, run

 $ cd build
 $ cmake <wherever>/kdesrc/kate -DINSTALL_PYTHON_FILES_IN_PYTHON_PREFIX=FALSE
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

To build with Python2 or Python3 explicitly:

 $ cmake <wherever>/kdesrc/kate -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2
 $ cmake <wherever>/kdesrc/kate -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3

Note that to switch between Python2 and Python3, you may need to delete all the
generate CMake files:

 $ cd build
 $ rm -rf CMake*
 $ cmake ...

Installation
============

To test the installation:

 $ python
 >>> import PyKate4.kate

Also, if you launch Kate frm the commandline, use kdebugdialog to enable
Kate plugin debugs, and Kate will report the version of Python for which
Pate was built:

kate(3564)/Kate (Plugins) Pate::Engine::init: Construct the Python engine for Python 2 7

Using Pâté
==========

See http://kate-editor.org/2012/06/26/python-plugin-user-guide/ for the
steps needed to enable Pâté.

See http://kate-editor.org/2012/07/01/python-plugin-developer-guide-part-1/
for a how-to guide to writing your own plugins.

Other plugins can be found on the Web; one source is:
